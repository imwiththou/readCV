      "description": "We are proud to introduce the United Design System (UDS), a design system that unifies and harmonises the user experience across all UOB digital platforms. UDS is the result of the Project Unity initiative that we launched in 2021, which aimed to consolidate and streamline seven different design systems that were used for various regions and projects. UDS is not just a collection of UI components, but a comprehensive product that guides our design principles, processes and best practices. UDS has gone through several iterations, starting from a basic MVP version in 2021 to a more refined and robust version nowadays. UDS is one of the most important piece of works from our UOB TMRW designOps team, as it enables us to deliver consistent, efficient and delightful digital banking experiences to our customers.",

Our inspiration for this season comes from the ground, where our dearest colleagues, peers, friends battle burnout, lack of creativity, toxic work environment, and frustration. In this season, we wanted to inspire you to seek things that bring you joy, to encourage you to take brave steps and venture into the unknown, to remind you that you are not alone on this path.",

UDS is not just a collection of UI components, but a comprehensive product that guides our design principles, processes and best practices. UDS has gone through several iterations, starting from a basic MVP version in 2021 to a more refined and robust version nowadays. UDS is one of the most important piece of works from our UOB TMRW designOps team, as it enables us to deliver consistent, efficient and delightful digital banking experiences to our customers.",
